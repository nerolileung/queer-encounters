  text: 'You climb, further and further. Nebula clings to your shoulder, her claws
    digging into your shirt.


    You climb. Why, you do not know. Nothing else
    in this adventure makes sense, so why should your decisions?


    You don''t
    know how long you climb for. An hour, maybe. Perhaps two. It''s impossible to
    be sure.'
