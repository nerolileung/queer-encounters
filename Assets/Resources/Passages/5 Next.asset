  text: You turn, making your way out of the cramped cockpit, and into the suffocatingly
    small engine bay. Here, the distant purr of the engine becomes a roar, the beast
    of machinery wedged between the walls, heat blasting from its surface. It flutters
    again as you squeeze beside it. You quickly find the issue, a loose fuel line
    this time, and coax it back into place. The wrench in your pocket helps to secure
    the line.
