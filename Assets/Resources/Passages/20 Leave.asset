  text: 'You turn, and head for the hatch of your ship. Your hand falls to your side,
    gripping your wrench for comfort.


    You stand in front of the door, and spin
    the locking wheel. Mechanical clunks ring out, and the door swings outward. A
    bracing breeze of sulfur, with a coppery sharpness, stings your nose. You hop
    down from the opening, and the ground crunches beneath you, like a crust over
    sand.


    Nebula hops down after you, and reaches up against your leg. Obligingly,
    you pick her up.


    Wrench in one hand, cat in the other, you march across
    the arid wastes of nowhere.'
