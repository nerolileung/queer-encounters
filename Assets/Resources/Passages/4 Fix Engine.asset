  text: 'You sigh, and nudge Nebula meaningfully with your arm. She picks her head
    up, turning her eyes to glare at you with disapproval only natural in felines.
    You sign to her an apology, and quickly scoop her up into your arms. She mews
    sadly as you set her onto the chair beside you. She pads at the package briefly,
    then curls around its warmth.


    You think that may also be against your contract.
    But she is just too cute.'
