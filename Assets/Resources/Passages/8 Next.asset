  text: 'Your console beeps once more. This time, your communicator has received
    a hail. From what... It cannot determine.


    You lean forward, and peer again
    at the signal. Space is an enormously vast place. There are only a few dozen
    ships out there with communicators like yours, and you are sure that none are
    out here.


    A button marked "RESPOND" glows green in the dim gloom of your
    cockpit.


    Do you respond to the hail?'
