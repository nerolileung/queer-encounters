  text: 'You walk for some time. Where to, you don''t know. You become aware of the
    temperature: how it is cold, but not freezing. With no sun in sight, it stands
    against reason that you should even be alive.


    You consider how you got
    here. Reason clearly holds no meaning here.


    You keep walking. Eventually,
    you come across a mountainside of purple stone. Purple clouds gather around its
    peak. You do not remember the mountain being there only moments ago.


    You
    look around.


    Do you walk away from the mountain?'
