  text: 'You return once again to the cockpit, and cycle the engine again. The purring
    slows, then ramps up again to a dull rumble, and then settles back into an easy

    You''re sat down
    barely a moment before Nebula perks her head up, and pounces on your vacant lap.
    She sits there, expectantly, and you lazily scratch at her cheek.'
