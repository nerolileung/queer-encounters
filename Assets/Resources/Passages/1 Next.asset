  text: You are sat in your chair, your feet kicked up on the dashboard, with Nebula,
    a greying tabby cat, sat upon your lap. You stroke her gently with your palm,
    and she purrs, like the rumble of the engine behind you. You glance briefly at
    the chair beside you, a package set upon the red leather. Your delivery. Your
    job.
