  text: 'You look down at the controls of your ship. Dark as they are, devoid of
    life, you doubt that they would function.


    You look more closely at the
    window. A large spider web of cracks has spread across the glass.


    You take
    a deep breath. Encouraged by the fact that you are not dead yet, you take another.
    Whatever is out there is breathable. At least, to some degree.


    Nebula rubs
    against your leg, a grain of normality in an absurd situation.


    Do you attempt
    to leave the ship?'
