  text: 'There is not void behind the glass.


    There is a single eye. A tear
    in space, glossy black, with a purple, misty pupil.


    It glares at you, and
    blinks.


    Time and space shatter under its gaze. Nothing else matters, in
    this moment before the end. It is all. It is everything.


    And, as soon as
    it appears, it is gone.


    You stare into the void and stars. Silence reigns.
    And then, your ship lands.'
