  text: 'Hi, I''m the mentor for the creators of this game. Game jams are great,
    a way to embrace your creativity to make something so unique that it couldn''t
    exist any other way. A way to learn new skills, meet new people, and most of
    all, have fun being part of something larger than yourself.


    If you are
    an aspiring game developer, or someone who just wants to have a go at making
    something for yourself: I urge you to find a jam, and join the awesome game development
    community.'
