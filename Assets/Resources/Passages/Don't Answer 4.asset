  text: Hi! I'm the programmer. This is also a game, one that has had love and effort
    put into it. I understand the urge to see how far you can push a game's options,
    but... please. I did some cool stuff with the sound system! Check it out! Press
    the spacebar, press enter, press literally any key except escape to start the
    story. Please.
