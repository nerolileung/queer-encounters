  text: 'This is a strange occurrence. You are certain beyond certainty, that there
    was no surface to land upon mere moments before.


    You look out the window
    once more. The inky sky, speckled with dots of light, looms above the horizon.
    But you are sure that that horizon should not be.


    A landscape of purplish
    rock stretches all around you, a rugged terrain of mountains, canyons, and arches,
    all of it alien and strange. A landscape lit only by the stars in the sky. A
    purplish aurora hangs above the distant horizon.'
