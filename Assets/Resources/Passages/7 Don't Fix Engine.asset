  text: 'The engine sputters again behind you. You are an experienced freighter,
    however. You know you can leave something like this for a few more minutes. It
    will be just fine.


    Nebula purrs some more, and you scratch below her chin.
    She lazily opens her eyes, staring off into the darkness beyond the window. You
    wonder, sometimes, if she understands where she is. If she knows, somehow, that
    she is millions of miles from the home she was born upon.


    You suspect she
    does not. She probably sees no reason to care.'
