    This is a story about you.


    Not you, of course. But you.
    Yes, you. You know who you are.


    I will describe this story to you. I will
    also give you choices. When you hear this sound... press the spacebar, and you
    will follow the course described. Choose not to, and you choose not to do the
    action.


    Would you like to continue?'
