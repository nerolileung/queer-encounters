  text: 'You''re surrounded by the mist at the peak now, a violet haze which blocks
    your vision. It smells of yeast, and baked bread.


    You keep climbing. Until,
    eventually, you break free from the fog of purple, and pull yourself onto the
    peak.


    It''s so beautiful here. The stars twinkle overhead, their majesty
    retold by your time spent apart. A sea of void surrounds you at the tip of the
    spire of the mountain, the violet clouds blending the land below into the sky.


    You
    look up. And an eye stares down at you.'
