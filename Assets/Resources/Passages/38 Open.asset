  text: 'You set Nebula down, and against all reason, you lift the lid of the box.
    You feel as though reason left you a long time ago.


    Inside, there is a
    single orb. Purple in colour. It glows slightly, and is hot to the touch.


    Something
    lies within the crystalline core. You do not know what it is.


    You close
    the box.'
